# Trouble Game Rules

## Game Overview
Trouble (also known as Frustration or Kimble) is a classic board game where players race their pegs around the board while trying to send opponents back to their starting positions. The first player to get all 4 pegs to the FINISH area wins!

## Components
- 1 plastic game unit with POP-O-MATIC die roller
- Game board with playing track
- 16 plastic playing pegs (4 per player/color)
- 4 rubber game board feet

## Objective
Be the first player to move all four of your colored pegs around the game board and into your FINISH line. During the game, strategically send your opponents' pegs back to HOME.

## Game Setup
1. Assemble the game board with the 4 rubber feet on the back
2. Each player selects a color and takes the 4 matching pegs
3. Place all 4 pegs in the matching color HOME area
4. Each player pops the die once - the highest number goes first
5. Play continues clockwise from the starting player

## Basic Game Play

### Starting the Game
- You must roll a **6** to move a peg from HOME to START
- If you don't roll a 6, your turn ends and you must wait
- Rolling a 6 gives you an additional pop and move

### Moving Pegs
- Move pegs **clockwise** around the board
- Move the exact number of spaces shown on the die
- Count each space whether empty or occupied
- You cannot land on your own pegs

### Sending Opponents Home
- Landing on an opponent's peg sends it back to HOME
- If an opponent is on your START space when you roll a 6, they're sent HOME
- Pegs sent HOME must start over completely

## Special Spaces and Rules

### Double Trouble (XX) Spaces
- Landing on these spaces grants an additional roll
- Maximum of 2 extra turns per turn total

### Warp Spaces
- Landing on a Warp space instantly transports your peg to the matching Warp space on the opposite side of the board
- If an opponent's peg occupies the destination Warp space, it's sent HOME
- If your own peg occupies the destination Warp space, your moving peg returns HOME
- You don't need an exact count to land on Warp spaces
- Warp spaces are not safe zones

### PowerUp Spaces (Roll of 1)
When you roll a **1**:
- The rolling player does nothing
- ALL other players may move one peg from HOME to START
- If a player's START space is blocked by their own peg, they cannot move

## Finishing the Game

### Entering the FINISH Area
- Pegs must travel once around the entire board
- **You MUST roll the EXACT number needed to enter a FINISH space**
- If you roll more than needed, you cannot move that peg
- You may move a different peg instead if possible

### FINISH Area Rules
- Pegs in FINISH are safe from opponents
- Pegs can only move forward in FINISH (follow arrow directions)
- Movement within FINISH requires exact count
- No player can enter another player's FINISH line

## Winning
- First player to get all 4 pegs into FINISH wins
- Game continues to determine 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place

## Turn Summary
1. Pop the die once
2. Apply special rules based on number rolled:
   - **1**: All other players move a peg to START (if possible)
   - **2-5**: Move one peg the indicated spaces
   - **6**: Move peg from HOME to START OR move existing peg 6 spaces, then pop again
3. Apply space effects:
   - **Opponent's peg**: Send it HOME
   - **Double Trouble (XX)**: Roll again (max 2 extra turns total)
   - **Warp space**: Transport to matching Warp on opposite side
4. End turn (unless you have extra rolls)

## Strategy Tips
- Use 6s wisely - decide whether to bring out new pegs or advance existing ones
- Target opponents close to their FINISH area
- Protect your pegs by keeping them spread out
- Use Warp spaces strategically to advance quickly or capture opponents
- Remember the exact count rule for FINISH - plan your moves accordingly
