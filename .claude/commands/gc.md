You should:

1. Use "git add ." to stage all changed files.
2. Group related files into the same commit.
3. Create separate commits for unrelated files.
4. Use descriptive commit messages.
5. Use bullet points in commit messages for multiple changes if necessary.

Remember these important guidelines for commit messages:
- Do not include Claude Code attribution in commit messages.
- Do not add "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code]" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines.
- Keep commit messages clean and focused on the actual changes.
- Use bullet points for multiple changes in a single commit if necessary.
